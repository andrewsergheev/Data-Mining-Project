This project is developed in a Jupyter Notebook. This is an University project and received 95% overall mark.
## Requirements
This coursework provides assessed practical experience in handling a data-mining project
using industry tooling for legacy data. The Data provided as part of this assessment is from
the domain of cardio-vascular medicine. The work herein requires the description and
analysis of data for the given domain, including manipulation of data in various forms, as well
as creation of classifiers.
You are expected to filter, clean, and transform data as appropriate such that it can be used
to produce optimal classification for patient risk. {NoRisk, Risk}.
This project is developed in a Jupyter Notebook
(.ipynb) responsible for following a given Data Mining Methodology towards the aims above.
This includes data reading, manipulation, selection, visualisation, model creation, and
evaluation.
